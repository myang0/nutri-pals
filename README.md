# Overview

Nutri-Pals is an Android app designed to incentivize meal-tracking in a fun, gamified way. In contrast to existing meal tracking apps that require a more complex set of nutritional inputs, Nutri-Pals aims to simplify this process and make it more approachable to newcomers. Users of this app will be taking care of a virtual pet, and by inputting the meals they eat along with some simple nutritional information of the meal, a corresponding meal will be fed to the pet. The pet's well-being will depend on the quality and variety of food it eats, and it will eventually evolve, taking a new form that is contingent on its status for the last two weeks.
